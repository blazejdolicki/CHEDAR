# CHEDAR

This repository contains the code for the paper CHEDAR: Conversation History Embedding for Dense Answer Retrieval.
Our research is built on top of the [ConvDR paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04166.pdf) and therefore we use their [respository](https://github.com/thunlp/ConvDR) as base for our approach.
We use the instructions provided by them to attempt to reproduce their results and we provide below their steps along with our modifications. (Some of their commands didn't match the code or missed steps)


*Commands to run CHEDAR are at the end of the README.

## ConvDR

## Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blazejdolicki/CHEDAR.git
cd CHEDAR/ConvDR
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We recommend set `PYTHONPATH` before running the code:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:`pwd`
```

To train ConvDR, we need trained ad hoc dense retrievers. We use [ANCE](https://github.com/microsoft/ANCE) for both tasks. Please download those checkpoints here: [TREC CAsT](https://webdatamltrainingdiag842.blob.core.windows.net/semistructstore/OpenSource/Passage_ANCE_FirstP_Checkpoint.zip). For TREC CAsT, we directly use the official model trained on MS MARCO Passage Retrieval task. 

The following code downloads those checkpoints and store them in `./checkpoints`.

```bash
mkdir checkpoints
wget https://webdatamltrainingdiag842.blob.core.windows.net/semistructstore/OpenSource/Passage_ANCE_FirstP_Checkpoint.zip
wget https://data.thunlp.org/convdr/ad-hoc-ance-orquac.cp
unzip Passage_ANCE_FirstP_Checkpoint.zip
mv "Passage ANCE(FirstP) Checkpoint" ad-hoc-ance-msmarco
```

## Data Preparation

By default, we expect raw data to be stored in `./datasets/raw` and processed data to be stored in `./datasets`:

```bash
mkdir datasets
mkdir datasets/raw
```

### TREC CAsT

#### CAsT shared files download

Use the following commands to download the document collection for CAsT-19 as well as the MARCO duplicate file:

```bash
cd datasets/raw
wget https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/collection.tar.gz 
tar -xf collection.tar.gz
mv collection.tsv msmarco.tsv
wget http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/v2.0/paragraphCorpus.v2.0.tar.xz
tar -xf paragraphCorpus.v2.0.tar.xz
wget http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Services/treccast19/duplicate_list_v1.0.txt
cd ../../
```

#### CAsT-19 files download

Download necessary files for CAsT-19 and store them into `./datasets/raw/cast-19`:

```bash
mkdir datasets/raw/cast-19
cd datasets/raw/cast-19
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daltonj/treccastweb/master/2019/data/evaluation/evaluation_topics_v1.0.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daltonj/treccastweb/master/2019/data/evaluation/evaluation_topics_annotated_resolved_v1.0.tsv
wget https://trec.nist.gov/data/cast/2019qrels.txt
cd ../../
```

#### CAsT preprocessing

Use the scripts `./data/preprocess_cast19`  to preprocess raw CAsT files:

```bash
mkdir datasets/cast-19
mkdir datasets/cast-shared
python data/preprocess_cast19.py  --car_cbor=datasets/raw/dedup.articles-paragraphs.cbor  --msmarco_collection=datasets/raw/msmarco.tsv  --duplicate_file=datasets/raw/duplicate_list_v1.0.txt  --cast_dir=datasets/raw/cast-19/  --out_data_dir=datasets/cast-19  --out_collection_dir=datasets/cast-shared
```

### Generate Document Embeddings

Our code is based on ANCE and we have a similar embedding inference pipeline, where the documents are first tokenized and converted to token ids and then the token ids are used for embedding inference. You can create sub-directories `tokenized` and `embeddings` inside `./datasets/cast-shared` to store the tokenized documents and document embeddings, respectively:

```bash
mkdir datasets/cast-shared/tokenized
mkdir datasets/cast-shared/embeddings
```
Note that we used embeddings and tokenized data from a shared folder on Lisa (`/project/gpuuva006/CAST19_ANCE_embeddings` and `/project/gpuuva006/team3/cast-tokenized/`), so you can use those directories if you have access to the cluster. If not, then use the folders `datasets/cast-shared/embeddings` and  `datasets/cast-shared/tokenized` as mentioned above but bear in mind that you need to change the directories in batch scripts.

Run `./data/tokenizing.py` to tokenize documents in parallel:

```bash
# CAsT
python data/tokenizing.py  --collection=datasets/cast-shared/collection.tsv  --out_data_dir=datasets/cast-shared/tokenized  --model_name_or_path=checkpoints/ad-hoc-ance-msmarco --model_type=rdot_nll
```

After tokenization, run `./drivers/gen_passage_embeddings.py` to generate document embeddings:

```bash
# CAsT
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=$gpu_no python drivers/gen_passage_embeddings.py  --data_dir=datasets/cast-shared/tokenized  --checkpoint=checkpoints/ad-hoc-ance-msmarco  --output_dir=datasets/cast-shared/embeddings  --model_type=rdot_nll
```

Note that we follow the ANCE implementation and this step takes up a lot of memory. To generate all 38M CAsT document embeddings safely, the machine should have at least 200GB memory. It's possible to save memory by generating a part at a time, and we may update the implementation in the future.

## ConvDR Training
### KD loss
Now we are all prepared: we have downloaded & preprocessed data, and we have obtained document embeddings. Simply run `./drivers/run_convdr_train.py` to train a ConvDR using KD (MSE) loss (batch script: `train_basic.sh`):

```bash
# CAsT-19, KD loss only, five-fold cross-validation
python drivers/run_convdr_train.py  --output_dir=checkpoints/convdr-kd-cast19  --model_name_or_path=checkpoints/ad-hoc-ance-msmarco  --train_file=datasets/cast-19/eval_topics.jsonl  --query=no_res  --per_gpu_train_batch_size=4  --learning_rate=1e-5   --log_dir=logs/convdr_kd_cast19  --num_train_epochs=8  --model_type=rdot_nll  --cross_validate
```

## ConvDR Inference

Run `./drivers/run_convdr_inference.py` to get inference results. `output_file` is the [OpenMatch](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenMatch)-format file for reranking, and `output_trec_file` is the TREC-style run file which can be evaluated by the [trec_eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval) tool (batch script: `inference_results.sh`).

```bash
# CAsT-19
python drivers/run_convdr_inference.py  --model_path=checkpoints/convdr-kd-cast19  --eval_file=datasets/cast-19/eval_topics.jsonl  --query=no_res  --per_gpu_eval_batch_size=8  --cache_dir=../ann_cache_dir  --ann_data_dir=datasets/cast-19/embeddings  --qrels=datasets/cast-19/qrels.tsv  --processed_data_dir=datasets/cast-19/tokenized  --raw_data_dir=datasets/cast-19   --output_file=results/cast-19/kd.jsonl  --output_trec_file=results/cast-19/kd.trec  --model_type=rdot_nll  --output_query_type=raw  --use_gpu  --cross_validate
```

The query embedding inference always takes the first GPU. If you set the `--use_gpu` flag (recommended), the retrieval will be performed on the remaining GPUs. The retrieval process consumes a lot of GPU resources. To reduce the resource usage, we split all document embeddings into several blocks, perform searching one-by-one and finally combine the results. If you have enough GPU resources, you can modify the code to perform searching all at once.

### Set up evaluation with `trec_eval`
Follow this steps to obtain evaluation metrics from the TREC-style file.
```
# git clone the aforementioned repository
git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval.git
# go to the root dir
cd trec_eval
# set up the repo
make
```
### Run evaluation
Run the following command (batch script: `trec_results.sh`)
```
./trec_eval -m ndcg_cut.3 -m recip_rank ../CHEDAR/ConvDR/datasets/cast-19/qrels.tsv ../CHEDAR/ConvDR/results/cast-19/kd.trec > ../CHEDAR/ConvDR/results/cast-19/kd_results.txt
```


# CHEDAR 

## LISA

In order to replicate the CHEDAR results, we have provided a list of batch scripts that run the training, inference and compute the trec results in the lisa cluster. These scripts can be found in `CHEDAR/ConvDR/batch_scripts/all_models/`. 
Here each batch script has the 3 steps of the pipeline and each of them correspond to a different model from the following list:

- m1: 2 linear layers + Relu
- m2:  2 linear layers + Sigmoid
- m3: 3 linear layers + ReLU
- m4: 2 linear layers + Relu + Residual (max)
- m5: GRU - 1 layer
- m6:  2 linear layers + Relu + Dropout
- m7:  3 (linear layers+residual) structure:  linear layer + Relu + Residual (max) + linear + relu+ linear + residual
- m8: LSTM - 1 layer
- m9:  2 linear layers + Relu + Residual (addition)
- m10:   3 linear layers + Relu + Residual (max)


Note: modify the path of the arguments in the batch scripts to match the files that were generated during the CONVDR steps. 

#### ConvDR
In the same there is also a script `all_convdr_kd_sequential.sh` that will do training, inference and compute results for our replication of ConvDR.

## Scripts Structure

It is also possible to run the steps to reproduce CHEDAR without the LISA cluster, for that we outline the commands required to do training, inference and compute the results (NDCG@3 and MRR).

After downloading, unzip the files and put them into datasets/cast-19/ directory.

#### Train
To train a chedar model you can run the `run_chedar_train.py` script with the arguments defined below. 
The CHEDAR variation can be selected using the argument `--history_encoder_type=1` where the number corresponds to the model described in the list above.
Make sure that the files in the paths of arguments `model_name_or_path` and `train_file` match your directory.

```
python drivers/run_chedar_train.py  --output_dir=checkpoints/chedar-kd-cast19-m1  \
                                    --model_name_or_path=checkpoints/ad-hoc-ance-msmarco  \
                                    --train_file=datasets/cast-19/SORTED_eval_topics.jsonl  \
                                    --query=no_res  \
                                    --per_gpu_train_batch_size=1  \
                                    --learning_rate=1e-5 \
                                    --log_dir=logs/chedar-kd-cast19-m1   \
                                    --num_train_epochs=8  \
                                    --model_type=rdot_nll  \
                                    --cross_validate  \
                                    --overwrite_output_dir \
                                    --history_encoder_type 1

```

#### Inference  
Similarly as in training the model variation can be defined with the argument `--history_encoder_type=1` and the files at paths from the arguments should match your directory
```
python drivers/run_chedar_inference.py  --model_path=checkpoints/chedar-kd-cast19-m1 \
                                        --eval_file=datasets/cast-19/SORTED_eval_topics.jsonl \
                                        --query=no_res \
                                        --per_gpu_eval_batch_size=1 \
                                        --cache_dir=../ann_cache_dir \
                                        --ann_data_dir=/project/gpuuva006/CAST19_ANCE_embeddings \
                                        --qrels=datasets/cast-19/qrels.tsv \
                                        --processed_data_dir=/project/gpuuva006/team3/cast-tokenized/ \
                                        --raw_data_dir=datasets/cast-19 \
                                        --output_file=results/cast-19/kd_chedar-train_folds-m1.jsonl \
                                        --output_trec_file=results/cast-19/kd_chedar-train_folds-m1.trec \
                                        --model_type=rdot_nll \
                                        --output_query_type=raw \
                                        --cross_validate \
                                        --use_gpu \
                                        --evaluate_on_train_folds  \
                                        --history_encoder_type 1
```

#### Results

If you followed the steps of ConvDR, you should now have a clone of the trec_eval repository, from there you can call the follow command to compute the proper NDCG@3 and MRR.
```
./trec_eval -m ndcg_cut.3 -m recip_rank ../CHEDAR/ConvDR/datasets/cast-19/qrels.tsv ../CHEDAR/ConvDR/results/cast-19/kd_chedar-train_folds-m1.trec > ../CHEDAR/ConvDR/results/cast-19/kd_chedar-train_folds-m1.txt
```
